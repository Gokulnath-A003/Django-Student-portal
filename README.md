# Student Result Portal With Automatic Progress Generator 
The Student Result Portal with Automatic Progress Generator is a mini project developed using Django, a
popular Python web framework. This project aims to create an efficient and user-friendly online platform for
students to access their academic results and generate automatic progress reports. The portal provides a secure login system that allows students to authenticate themselves and gain access to
their personal academic information. Once logged in, students can view their internal-wise results, including
graphs, marks,remarks,stars and other relevant details. One of the key features of this project is the automatic progress report generator. It utilizes the data available
in the student's results and generates a comprehensive progress report summarizing their academic
performance over multiple internal exams.
